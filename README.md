# Appcent_case_study
## Mini Deezer
### K. Barış Gökmen

This was a mock project for employement process by Appcent. I have android development experience before (my graduation project and internship). But I have not used MVVM design pattern. In this project, I have learned and practiced the MMVM design pattern, data handling on RESTful APIs (Deezer API in this project) and general Android development with Kotlin. <br /><br />
I have enjoyed while making this project, and I'm happy with the final product that I made. I would like to improve and add
new features to the app after this process. <br /><br />

NOTE: I added "Search" functionality besides the design document of the company. <br /><br />
